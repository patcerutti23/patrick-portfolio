              Hello! I'm J. Patrick Cerutti, a versatile Software Engineer with
              a background as a former Physical Therapist. My journey from
              healthcare to the world of technology has equipped me with a
              unique perspective and a diverse skill set that I'm excited to
              bring to the table.

              With a passion for leveraging technology to solve real-world
              problems, I've transitioned into the role of a Full Stack Web
              Developer. My experience as a Physical Therapist exposed me to the
              challenges of time-consuming diagnosis code searches, which led me
              to develop a fuzzy search web app to streamline the processâ€”a
              project that ignited my enthusiasm for technology.

              versatility and adaptability to different tech stacks. I'm a
              dedicated lifelong learner, always seeking opportunities to expand
              my skills as an Engineer.
